\model{Circular linked lists}\
  \quest{5 min}
  \Q  If the linked list's last node does not have next assigned as NULL, but rather another node in the list, we have a circular linked list.
      Write a code snippet to create 3 nodes in main that creates a circular linked list.
      Use numbers 1, 2, and 3 for the values of the linked list.
      \begin{answer}[1in]
        \begin{cpplst}
Node *node1 = makeNode(1, NULL);
Node *node2 = makeNode(2, NULL);
Node *node3 = makeNode(3, NULL);}
        \end{cpplst}
      \end{answer}
