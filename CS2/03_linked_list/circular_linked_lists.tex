          {\bf\large Model 3: Circular linked lists}

    \item  If the linked list's last node does not have next assigned as NULL, but rather another node in the list, we have a circular linked list.
          Write a code snippet to create 3 nodes in main that creates a circular linked list.
          Use numbers 1, 2, and 3 for the values of the linked list.
