\model{Analysis Functions}

Label each of the following methods either $\Theta(1)$, $\Theta(n)$, or $\Theta(n^{2})$.

\begin{javalst}
int max(int a, int b) {
  if (a > b) {
    return a;
  } else {
    return b;
  }
}
\end{javalst}

\Q
The \texttt{max} method is $\Theta(\hspace{1 pc})$. Justify your answer.


\begin{answer}[.25in]
\end{answer}


\begin{javalst}
int maxElement(int[ ] array) {
  int max = array[0];
  for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] > max) {
      max = array[i];
    }//end if
  } //end for
  return max;
}
\end{javalst}


\Q
The \texttt{maxElement} method is $\Theta(\hspace{1 pc})$. Justify your answer.


\begin{answer}[.25in]
\end{answer}

\begin{javalst}
int maxSubseqSum(int[ ] array) {
  int max = array[0];
  for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int j = i; j < array.length; j++) {
      sum += j;
      if (sum > max) {
        max = sum;
      } //end if
    } //end for
  } //end for
  return max;
}
\end{javalst}


\Q
The \texttt{maxSubseqSum} method is $\Theta(\hspace{1 pc})$. Justify your answer.

\Q
We are using the number of operations a method executes as a measure
of its run time.  In a few complete sentences, explain why we are using
this measure of time rather than a wall-clock measure of time (\emph{i.e.},
minutes, seconds, \emph{etc}.).

\Q
Why is knowing that a method is $\Theta(n)$ more valuable than knowing that
it takes fifteen seconds to execute on a 2.7GHz i7? In the space below,
list the pros and cons for each statement.\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``The method is $\Theta(n)$.''
          \begin{answer}[1.25in]
          \end{answer}

    \item ``The method took 15s on my i7.''
          \begin{answer}[1.25in]
          \end{answer}
\end{itemize}



\Q
Is it possible that there are inputs for which a $\Theta(1)$ method
executes more operations than a $\Theta(n)$ method that has the same
specification? Why or why not?
