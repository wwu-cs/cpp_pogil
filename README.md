# CS C++ Pogil Activities

These POGIL activities are a mix of original activities and adapted Python or Java activitities to C++.

**POGIL activities for CS1 and CS2.**

Many authors have contributed to these activities, including Jonathan Duncan, Preston Carman, and James Foster.
Our ideas and many activities go back to the original others: Chris Mayfield, Helen Hu, Clif Kussmaul, and others.
See individual source files for specific attribution.

The documents in this repository are written in LaTeX.
Each source file contains a single model and its accompanying questions.
Activities are composed by including (with \input) a sequence of models.

You can browse each of the models and activities separately.
The `build.py` script compiles student and teacher PDFs for each LaTeX source file.

The diagrams and other figures were drawn using [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), and [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/).
For some diagrams, the source files are included, and for others, the source is embedded in the pdf itself.
