    \Q The complete program can be found in {\tt activity07b.cpp}.  Run it and answer the following questions.
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item What is the output when you enter the number 5?  How many times did the loop execute?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            The loop executed five times.  The output is:\par
            % \mintinline{html}| 1  2  3  4  5|
          \end{answer}
        \item What is the output when you enter the number 25? How many times did the loop execute?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            The loop executed 25 times.  The output is:\par
            % \mintinline{html}| 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10|\\
            % \mintinline{html}|11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20|\\
            % \mintinline{html}|21 22 23 24 25|
          \end{answer}
        \item Unlike the loop in model 1, this loop prints the counter.  How might this make testing easier?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            Debugging is easier as you can see the counter values each time through the loop.
          \end{answer}
      \end{enumerate}

    \Q The following code snippet should print the numbers from 1 to 10, but it doesn't print anything.  Correct the
      problem.  Replace the contents of {\tt activity07b.cpp} to help in your debugging.

    \Q The following step-by-step instructions will assist you in creating a program that prompts the user for a number
      between 1 and 10 (inclusively).  As long as the number is out of range, it re-prompts the user for a valid number.
      
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Write code to prompt the user for a number between 1 and 10 and store it in a variable.
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            \cpp{int} number; cout "Enter a number between 1 and 10: "; cin >> number;|
          \end{answer}
          
        \item Write a {\bf Boolean expression} that is true exactly when the variable is {\bf not} between 1 and 10.
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            \cpp{(number < 1) || (number > 10)}
          \end{answer}
          
\newpage

        \item Use the Boolean expression you just created to write a {\bf while loop} that executes when the user input is out
          of range.  Leave the body of the while loop empty for now.
          \begin{answer}[1in]
            \cpp{while ((number < 1) || (number > 10)) { }}
          \end{answer}
          
        \item Write code to prompt the user to re-enter a valid number and store it in the same variable.
          \begin{answer}[1in]
            \cpp{cout << "Invalid! Enter a number between 1 and 10: "; cin >> number;}
          \end{answer}
          
        \item Finally, write code that prints out a message telling the user they entered a valid number.
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            \cpp{cout << "Congrats! You (finally) entered a valid number." << endl;}
          \end{answer}
        
        \item Now put all of the pieces together and replace the code in {\tt activity07b.cpp}.  Does your code work properly?
          If not, correct it and test again.        
      
      \end{enumerate}
      
    \Q A {\it counter-controlled loop} is one for which the number of times
      the loop will execute is known ahead of time. Which of the loops in this
      model (questions 5, 7, 8, and 9) are counter-controlled?
      \begin{answer}[0.4in]
        The loops in 5, 7, and 8 are counter-controlled.  The loop in 9 is not.
      \end{answer}
      
    \Q Enter and execute the following code in the file {\tt activity07b.cpp}.  Remember to 
      \cpp{#include <string>} at the top of your file.

      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item What does this program do?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            It prints out the first letter of any word entered until the user enters `y'.
          \end{answer}
        \item What is the variable name used to store the user's input?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            The word entered is stored in {\tt word} and the request to do again in {\tt doAgain}.
          \end{answer}
\newpage          
        \item What does \cpp{word.at(0)} represent?

            The first character of the word entered.
          \end{answer}
        \item What happens if you change 0 to 1 in \cpp{word.at(0)}?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            You would get the second character of the word entered.
          \end{answer}
        \item When will the program end?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            When the user types anything other than `y' when prompted to continue.
          \end{answer}
          \par\vskip -30pt\null          
        \item A {\it sentinel-controlled loop} is one in which the loop body repeats
          until the user enters a\key\\[-2.5mm] particular value or values.  Why is 
          this an example of a {\it sentinel-controlled loop}?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            Because it will keep going until the user decides not to.
          \end{answer}
      \end{enumerate}
