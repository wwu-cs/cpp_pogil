    be most appropriate.
    
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      Most likely we would want:
        {\it number: long}
        {\it expire: Date}
        {\it name: String}
        {\it CCV: int}
    \end{answer}
    
  \Q When constructing or updating a {\tt CreditCard} objects, what
    values would you need to check?  What are the valid ranges of each
    attribute?
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
        The number should have 16 digits.
        Dates need to have valid months and years.
        Names should be at most 22 letters long and not contain
          non-alphabet characters.
        CCV codes should be 3 or 4 digits long.

    two types of cards and their relationship to the original {\tt
    CreditCard} class you defined above.
