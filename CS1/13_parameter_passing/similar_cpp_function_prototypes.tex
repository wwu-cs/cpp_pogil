  \Q What is the name of the function whose prototype is given on each of the
    following lines?
    \begin{enumerate}
      \itemsep 10pt
      \begin{multicols}{2}
        \item Line 1 \hspace{10pt} \ans[0.5in]{\tt Maximum}
        \item Line 2 \hspace{10pt} \ans[0.5in]{\tt Maximum}
        \item Line 3 \hspace{10pt} \ans[0.5in]{\tt Maximum}
        \item Line 4 \hspace{10pt} \ans[0.5in]{\tt Maximum}
      \end{multicols}
    \end{enumerate}

  \Q On which line number is the function prototype to which each
    function call below matches?  Try running the code in {\tt
    activity13c.cpp} and reading any compile error messages to help you decide.  
    \begin{enumerate}
      \itemsep 10pt
      \item \cpp{cout << Maximum(5,1,3)} \hfill
        \ans[3in]{Line 2}
      \item \cpp{cout << Maximum(5,1.5,3)} \hfill
        \ans[3in]{Ambiguous (either line 2 or line 4)}
      \item \cpp{cout << Maximum(5,3)} \hfill
        \ans[3in]{Line 1}
      \item \cpp{cout << Maximum(2.3,4.7)} \hfill
        \ans[3in]{Line 3}
    \end{enumerate}
    
  \Q How could you tell which function call go with which prototype?
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      Match the number, type, and order of the arguments with
      the parameters.  If there is no exact match, typecasting may
      be used but must be unambiguous (i.e. only one possible match).
    \end{answer}
    
  \Q A function's {\it signature} is its name and the number, type, and
    order of its parameters.  Give prototypes for at least two additional functions
    with the name {\tt Maximum} that have different function signatures.
    \begin{answer}[0.35in]
      \cpp{string Maximum(string, string)} 
      and 
      \cpp{int Maximum(int, int, int, int)}\hfill
    \end{answer}
    
  \Q Give at least one new (different) prototype for a function named 
    {\tt Maximum} that has the same signature as one of those in the model.
    \begin{answer}[0.35in]
      \cpp{void Maximum(int, int)}
    \end{answer}

  \Q Add your prototypes from the last two problems to the file {\tt
    activity13c.cpp} to \key\\[-2.5mm]see which the compiler accepts and which produce errors.
    Based on that, make a conjecture about when you can have functions with the same
    name in C++.
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      Functions can have the same name if their signatures are different.
