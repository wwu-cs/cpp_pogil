  \Q What does this program display?  Try to determine this
    without running it first, then check your work against
    the output of the program in {\tt activity09a.cpp}.
    \begin{answer}[0.75in]
      \par
      The program prints out a 3 x 5 grid of the person's name.
    \end{answer}
    
  \Q Answer the following questions regarding the      
    \cpp{for} loops in this code snippet.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
      \itemsep 10pt
      \item How many \cpp{for} loops are in this code?: \hfill
        \ans[2.5in]{There are two}

      \item Does one loop completely finish before the next begins?  \hfill
        \ans[2.5in]{No.  One loop is inside the other}

      \item What do you call this arrangement of loops?  \hfill
        \ans[2.5in]{These are nested loops}
    \end{enumerate}
  
  \Q How many times does each {\tt cout} statement in this model
    execute?
    \begin{enumerate}
      \itemsep 10pt
      \item The {\tt cout} on line 7 of the model:\hfill
        \ans[2.5in]{Executes once}

      \item The {\tt cout} on line 11 of the model: \hfill
        \ans[2.5in]{Executes $5\times 3 = 15$ times}

      \item The {\tt cout} on line 13 of the model: \hfill
        \ans[2.5in]{Executes five times}
    \end{enumerate}

  \Q A loop that appears within another loop is called a {\it
    nested loop}.  We can refer to the two loops as the {\it outer
    loop} and the {\it inner loop}.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
      \itemsep 10pt
      \item On what line number in the model does the outer loop start?\hfill
        \ans[2in]{Line 9}

      \item On what line number in the model does the inner loop start? \hfill
        \ans[2in]{Line 10}

      \item On what line number does the inner loop in the model end?\hfill
        \ans[2in]{Line 12}

      \item On what line number does the outer loop in the model end?\hfill
        \ans[2in]{Line 14}
    \end{enumerate}

  \Q What does each of the loops in the model do?\key\\[-2.5mm]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What does the inner loop do?
        \begin{answer}[0.5in]
          The inner loop prints out a name 3 times with a space
          after each one.
        \end{answer}

      \item What does the outer loop do?
        \begin{answer}[0.5in]
          The outer loop repeats the inner loop 5 times and prints
          an {\tt endl} after each one.
        \end{answer}
    \end{enumerate}
