    \Q What does this program display?  Try to determine this
      without running it first, then check your work against
      the output of the program in {\tt activity09a.cpp}.
      \begin{answer}[0.75in]
        \par
        The program prints out a 3 x 5 grid of the person's name.

      \cpp{for} loops in this code snippet.

      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \itemsep 15pt
        \item How many \cpp{for} loops are in this code?: \hfill
          \ans[2.5in]{There are two}
        \item Does one loop completely finish before the next begins?  \hfill
          \ans[2.5in]{No.  One loop is inside the other}
        \item What do you call this arrangement of loops?  \hfill
          \ans[2.5in]{These are nested loops}

    \Q How many times does each {\tt cout} statement in this model
      execute?

        \itemsep 15pt
        \item The {\tt cout} on line 7 of the model:\hfill
          \ans[2.5in]{Executes once}
        \item The {\tt cout} on line 11 of the model: \hfill
          \ans[2.5in]{Executes $5\times 3 = 15$ times}

    \Q A loop that appears within another loop is called a {\it
      nested loop}.  We can refer to the two loops as the {\it outer
      loop} and the {\it inner loop}.

    \Q What does each of the loops in the model do?\key\\[-2.5mm]
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item What does the inner loop do?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            The inner loop prints out a name 3 times with a space
            after each one.
          \end{answer}
        \item What does the outer loop do?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            The outer loop repeats the inner loop 5 times and prints
            an {\tt endl} after each one.
          \end{answer}
