    \Q This code can be found in {\tt activity18a.cpp}.  Run it and
      record what output appears on the screen.
      % \ifprintanswers\vskip -20pt\null\fi
      \begin{answer}[1in]
        The program says:
        \begin{itemize}
          \itemsep 0pt
          \item Enter first name:
          \item Enter last name:
          \item Enter student ID:
          \item Done! Data is saved in: studentInfo.txt
        \end{itemize}
      \end{answer}

    \Q Locate the file {\tt studentInfo.txt} and examine its contents.

        \itemsep 15pt
        \item What is in this file?
          \hfill \ans[3in]{the student info we entered}
        \item Did this file exist before the program ran?
          \hfill \ans[3in]{no, it was created by the program}
        \item On which line of code was the file created?
          \hfill \ans[3in]{line 10, by the {\tt .open()} command}
        \item Which lines generated the file contents?
          \hfill \ans[3in]{lines 16 through 18}
        \item Why wasn't the message on line 21 in the file?
          \hfill \ans[3in]{because it was sent to {\tt cout} not {\tt fout}}

    \Q Run the program again using different input.  Then open the
      {\tt studentInfo.txt} file.  What is in the file?  Is the data
      from the first time you ran it still there?
      \begin{answer}[0.5in]
        The file has original student's info as well as the
        new one from our second execution.

    \Q Remove the {\tt ofstream::app} argument in the {\tt .open()}
      function call on line 10 and run the\key\\[-2.5mm] program again with different input.

      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item What happened to the contents of {\tt studentInfo.txt}?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            The contents of {\tt studentInfo.txt} were replaced with the
            new input.
          \end{answer}
        \item What did the {\tt ofstream::app} argument do?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            The argument made the program {\it append} to the
            file instead of {\it overwrite} the file.
          \end{answer}
      \end{enumerate}
            
      
    \Q You should have observed that lines 16-18 send output to the
      the file {\tt studentInfo.txt}.  How does C++ know to send the
      output to that file?
      \begin{answer}[0.5in]
        The {\tt fout} variable was opened with that file name.
      \end{answer}
      
    \Q Rewrite the program so the user can keep entering names
      until they type in {\tt DONE} for the first name.
      \begin{answer}[1.75in]
        Wrap lines 12-18 in a {\tt do-while} loop with condition 
        \cpp|firstName != "DONE"}.
