  \Q This code can be found in {\tt activity18a.cpp}.  Run it and
    record what output appears on the screen.
    \begin{answer}[1in]
      \scriptsize
      The program says:
      \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep 1pt
        \item Enter first name:
        \item Enter last name:
        \item Enter student ID:
        \item Done! Data is saved in: studentInfo.txt
      \end{itemize}
    \end{answer}

  \Q Locate the file {\tt studentInfo.txt} and examine its contents.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \itemsep 10pt
      \item What is in this file?
        \hfill \ans[3in]{the student info we entered}

      \item Did this file exist before the program ran?
        \hfill \ans[3in]{no, it was created by the program}

      \item On which line of code was the file created?
        \hfill \ans[3in]{line 9, by the {\tt .open()} command}

      \item Which lines generated the file contents?
        \hfill \ans[3in]{lines 22 through 24}

      \item Why wasn't the message on line 28 in the file?
        \hfill \ans[3in]{because it was sent to {\tt cout} not {\tt fout}}
    \end{enumerate}

  \Q Run the program again using different input.  Then open the
    {\tt studentInfo.txt} file.  What is in the file?  Is the data
    from the first time you ran it still there?
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      The file has original student's info as well as the
      new one from our second execution.
    \end{answer}

  \Q Remove the {\tt ofstream::app} argument in the {\tt .open()}
    function call on line 9 and\key\\[-2.5mm] run the program again with different input.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What happened to the contents of {\tt studentInfo.txt}?
        \begin{answer}[0.5in]
          The contents of {\tt studentInfo.txt} were replaced with the
          new input.
        \end{answer}

      \item What did the {\tt ofstream::app} argument do?
        \begin{answer}[0.5in]
          The argument made the program {\it append} to the
          file instead of {\it overwrite} the file.
        \end{answer}
    \end{enumerate}

  \Q You should have observed that lines 22-24 send output to the
    the file {\tt studentInfo.txt}.  How does C++ know to send the
    output to that file?
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      The {\tt fout} variable was opened with that file name.
    \end{answer}
    
  \Q Rewrite the program so the user can keep entering names
    until they type in {\tt DONE} for the first name.
    \begin{answer}[1.75in]
      Wrap lines 13-24 in a {\tt do-while} loop with condition 
      \cpp{firstName != "DONE"}.
    \end{answer}
