In this activity, you will work in teams of 3--4 students to learn new concepts.
This activity will introduce you to proper C++ programming style.

\guide{
  \item Identify good C++ programming style for variables, expressions, and functions
  \item Articulate style guidelines for variables, expressions, and functions in C++
  \item Identify good style in coding practices

}{
  \item Rewrite code to improve its style \\[-5pt]

    \it 
    Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you\\
    write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart 
    enough to debug it.\\
