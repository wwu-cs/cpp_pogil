In this course, you will work in teams of 3--4 students to learn new concepts.
This activity will introduce you to arrays in C++.

\guide{
  \item Explain the difference between vector and array syntax in C++
  \item Identify one- and two-dimensional arrays and understand their syntax in C++
  \item Understand how one- and two-dimensional arrays are passed to functions in C++

}{
  \item Translate code between vectors and one-dimensional arrays in C++
  \item Write code to manipulate two-dimensional arrays in C++ \\[-5pt]
}{
No additional notes.
