  \Q This program can be found in {\tt activity04c.cpp}.  Run it and then answer the following questions.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \itemsep 15pt
      \item What is the printed value of the variable {\tt integer} in part I?  \hfill \ans[1.5in]{35}
      \item What is the printed value of the variable {\tt floatOne} in part I?  \hfill \ans[1.5in]{35}
      \item What is the printed value of the variable {\tt floatOne} in part II? \hfill \ans[1.5in]{3.9}
      \item What is the printed value of the variable {\tt floatTwo} in part II? \hfill \ans[1.5in]{3}
    \end{enumerate}
            
  \Q Lines 10 and 15 are both examples of {\it type casting}.  What is a type cast?
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      It is when a variable of one type is treated as if it were a variable of another type.
    \end{answer}
    
  \Q In the previous model we saw the term {\it implicit type casting}.  Another type of type casting is {\it explicit
    type casting}.  Which statement (line 10 or 15) is an example of an explicit type cast? 
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      Line 15 is an explicit type cast because we specifically asked the computer to treat {\tt floatOne} as an integer.
    \end{answer}

  \Q What is the difference between an implicit type cast and an explicit type cast?
    \begin{answer}[1in]
      \par
      An implicit type cast happens automatically, while an explicit type cast is asked for.
    \end{answer}
    
  \Q What is the C++ syntax for an explicit type cast?  Give an example other than the one in the model.
    \begin{answer}[1in]
      \par
      The syntax is \cpp{static_cast<newType>(variable)}.  Examples will vary.
    \end{answer}
    
  \Q Write a snippet of code that will output the string WWU without using the ``W'' \key\\[-2.5mm] or ``U'' characters.
    Hint: use explicit type casting and the ASCII table seen in model 2.\\
