  {\it\large Refer to Model 2 above as your team develops consensus answers
    to the questions below.}

    \Q The code for this program is in {\tt
      activity08b.cpp}.  Run it and explain what the program does.
      \begin{answer}[1in]
        \par
        The program prompts the user for five numbers and then prints
        out the sum of those five numbers.
      \end{answer}
      
    \Q Explain what each of the indicated lines of code from the model above does.
      \par\vskip 10pt
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \itemsep 15pt
        \item Line 6:    \hfill \ans[5.25in]{Initializes the variable {\tt total} to zero}
        \item Line 7:    \hfill \ans[5.25in]{Sets up the {\tt for} loop to repeat five times.}
        \item Line 10:   \hfill \ans[5.25in]{Adds the user-entered number to the accumulated total}
      \end{enumerate}
      
    \Q An {\it accumulator} is a variable that stores the sum of a group of values.  Which variable 
      in this model is an accumulator?  Check all that apply.
      
      \begin{checkboxes}
        \begin{multicols}{3}
          \choice {\tt number}
          \correctchoice {\tt total}
          \choice {\tt i}
        \end{multicols}
      \end{checkboxes}

    \Q Why is the variable {\tt total} initialized to zero in line 2 of the model?
      \begin{answer}[0.5in]
        \par
        Because we need to start the loop with nothing accumulated so that after the loop is
        done, total will contain just the sum of the five numbers entered.
      \end{answer}

    \Q Would it be possible to use the same variable as both a counter and an accumulator? Explain.
      \begin{answer}[0.5in]
        \par
        No.  A counter must count how many times the loop executes, so 
        it can not accumulate a sum of a group of values.
      \end{answer}

    \Q An accumulator can also store the product of a set of numbers.  How, if at all, would you \key\\[-2.5mm]
      change the following lines of the model to compute $5!$ ($5! = 1\times 2\times 3\times 4\times 5$ is called ``five factorial'').
      
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item How would you change \cpp{int total = 0;} on line 6?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            It would become \cpp{int total=1;} to initialize the accumulator to 1 instead of 0.
          \end{answer}
        \item How would you change \cpp{for (int i = 0; i < 5; i += 1)} on line 7?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            This does not need to change.
          \end{answer}
        \item How would you change lines 8-9 in the model?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            They would be deleted since user input is no longer needed.
          \end{answer}
        \item How would you change \cpp{total += number} on line 10 of the model?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            It would become \cpp{total *= i+1} to multiply the accumulator by the counter.
          \end{answer}
      \end{enumerate}
