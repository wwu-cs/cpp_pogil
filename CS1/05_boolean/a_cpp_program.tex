      \Q This program can be found in {\tt activity05c.cpp}.  Run it and determine the output produced by each
        \cpp{cout} statement.

      \Q Based on the output observed in lines 8 and 9, how does C++ represent true and false?
        \begin{answer}[0.4in]
          True is represented as 1 and false as 0.

      \Q Based on the output from lines 8 and 10, how does C++ treat \cpp{=} and \cpp{==}
        differently?\key\\[-2.5mm]
        \begin{answer}[0.4in]
          \par
          A single = is an assignment statement (line 10 assigns the value of b to a) that
          returns the value being assigned.  The double == is a relational operator 
          and returns either true (1) or false (0).
        \end{answer}
        
      \Q In the code above, line 11 prints a value, while line 12 produces an error.  Why do you think
        that is?
        \begin{answer}[0.4in]
          \par
          On line 11, only the first part, \cpp{a > c}, is evaluated because the second part of the OR
          statement does not need to be checked to tell that the whole thing will be true.  So we never divide by zero.
          But on line 12, the AND is only true if both sides are true, so we must check the second part, resulting in
          division by zero.
        \end{answer}
