    \Q A {\it string literal} is a sequence of characters surrounded by double
      quotation marks (" ").  Use this term to describe the difference between part (a)
      and part (b) above.
      \begin{answer}[1in]
        Part (a) prints out the string literal "Hello, my name is Jon" while in part (b)
        the lack of quotation marks confuses the compiler.
      \end{answer}
      
    \Q What caused the different output format for statements (a) and (c) in question 2?
      \begin{answer}[1in]
        The $\backslash$n in part (c) caused a line break instead of the space we
        got in part (a)
      \end{answer}

          \ans[2.5in]{It prints {\it Age: 20}}

    \Q With reference to the output for each statement in question 5,
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \itemsep 10pt
        \item What is the difference in the output for statements (a) and (c)?
          \begin{answer}[1in]
            Statement (a) prints computes the value of 2+5 and prints it out, while
            statement (c) prints out the literal characters {\it 2+5}.
          \end{answer}          
        \item What caused the difference?
          \begin{answer}[0.5in]
            The quotation marks around the {\it 2+5} in statement (c) made it into a
            string literal.
          \end{answer}
        \item Which statement(s) contained a {\it string literal}? Explain. \hfill
          \ans[2.5in]{Statement (c), it has quotes around it}
        \item What does the extra {\tt <<} do in part (d) of question 4?  How does it
          affect the spacing of the output?
          \begin{answer}[1in]
            \par
            It outputs the second item right after the first, resulting in {\it Age:} and
            {\it 20} being put together.\par
            It does not add any extra space between the two items.
          \end{answer}
      \end{enumerate}
