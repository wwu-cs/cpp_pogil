  In this course, you will work in teams of 3--4 students to learn new concepts.
  This activity will introduce you to arithmetic operators and assignment statements in C++.

  \guide{
    \item Explain each C++ arithmetic operator
    \item Explain the meaning and purpose of an assignment statement
    \item Differentiate between integer division and floating point division
    \item Explain the use of "+" with strings and numbers
  }{
    \item Create input and output statements in C++
    \item Create C++ code that performs mathematical and string operations
    \item Create C++ code that uses assignment statements
    \item Discuss problems and programs with all group members\\[-5pt]
  }{
  No additional notes.
