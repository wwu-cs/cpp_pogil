  {\it\large Refer to Model 3 above as your group develops consensus answers
    to the questions below.}

      \Q Circle the {\tt if/else} statement that is {\it nested} inside of 
        another {\tt if/else} statement.
        \begin{answer}[0.4in]
          The {\tt if/else} statement from lines 11-14 is nested inside the one from lines 8-16.
        \end{answer}

      \Q This code can be found in the file {\tt activity06c.cpp}.  Give three different grade
        values that could be used to test different parts of the program.  Indicate what part of 
        the program the value is testing.

          Yes, the program does appear to work as expected.

      \Q Consider the code snippet below.
        \begin{center}
          \begin{minipage}{3.5in}
            \begin{cprlst}[
              frame=lines,

  if (grade >= 90) {
    cout << "Very Good!" << endl;
  } else if (grade >= 60) {
    cout << "Satisfactory." << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "Poor." << endl;
  }

        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Replace lines 8-18 in model 3 with this code. How does the output change?
            \begin{answer}[0.5in]
              The output does not change.
            \end{answer}
            
          \item Which method of solving this problem contains simpler syntax and indentation -- the 
            one in the original model, or the one above?  Explain.
            \begin{answer}[0.5in]
              The new one has simpler syntax and does not require nesting.
            \end{answer}
            
          \item You can use as many {\tt else/if} statements as you need.  Suppose you wanted to add the comment ``Good!'' for grades
            that are between 80 and 90.  Write the code for this change.

          \item Does it make a difference where you add the additional {\tt else/if} statement?
            Compare\key\\[-2.5mm] adding it at line 10 in the code snippet above vs. at line 12.
            \begin{answer}[1in]
              Yes, it makes a difference.  If we add it at line 12 instead of at line 10, then the ``Good!'' option is never used because
              any grade above 80 will also be above 60 and would fall into the earlier ``Satisfactory.''
              part of the {\tt if/else/if} statement.
            \end{answer}
            
          \item Is the use of the final {\tt else} statement mandatory when creating an {\tt if/else/if} statement?  
            Try it out and supply an example to support your claim.
            \begin{answer}[0.75in]
              Not mandatory.  Dropping lines 12-14 will just print nothing for grades less than 60.
            \end{answer}
            
          \item Make one final change to your program.  Adjust it so that it prints an error message 
            if the grade entered is greater than 100 or less than 0.
        \end{enumerate}
