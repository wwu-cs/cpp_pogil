  In our discussion of encoding (lesson 1) we noted that characters (including letters, numbers, and punctuation) could be represented as a glyph (using ink on paper), as a gesture (using American Sign Language), as a combination of short and long tones (Morse Code), or as raised dots on paper (Braille). At the end of the lesson on subtraction (lesson 6) we noted that anything that can be mapped to discrete values, like the form of the British invasion (``one if by land, two if by sea''), could be encoded as binary numbers.

  In this lesson we look at encoding printable characters as numeric codes.
