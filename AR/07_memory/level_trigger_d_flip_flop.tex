  \Q Recall that an AND gate has an output of 1 only if both inputs are 1. In Figure 8 enter the value 0 for Write, Data, and output (Q). Highlight the lines that have high voltage for this state to exist.

  \Q With the circuit in the state shown in Figure 8, imagine that Data changes from 0 to 1. Highlight the lines in Figure 9 that have high voltage and update Q.

  We now have a circuit that latches onto (remembers) a data line only when the write line is 1.
