\model{Feedback}

  Recall that a relay consists of a coil of wire around a ferromagnetic material (such as iron) with a switch that is pulled toward
  the coil when electricity flows because the coil becomes magnetic. The switch connects an input signal or wire to one of two output
  terminals depending on whether electricity is flowing.

  \quest{10 min}

  \Q When the switch is open, does electricity flow through the circuit?
    \hfill\ans[1in]{no}

  \Q When the switch is initially closed, does electricity start to flow through the circuit?
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      yes
    \end{answer}

  \Q What happens to the coil on the relay soon after step 2?
    \hfill\ans{It becomes magnetized}

  \Q What happens to the bar on the relay soon after step 3?
    \hfill\ans{It switches (drops down) to the other pole}

  \Q What happens to the circuit after step 4?
    \hfill\ans{Electricity stops flowing}

  \Q What happens to the coil soon after step 5?
    \hfill\ans{It becomes demagnetized}

  \Q What happens to the bar soon after step 6?
    \hfill\ans{It switches (up) to the top pole}

  \Q What happens to the circuit after step 7?
    \hfill\ans{Electricity starts flowing again}

  \Q Summarize what happens when the switch is closed (steps 2-8).
    \begin{answer}[0.75in]
      The relay switches back and forth continuously.
    \end{answer}

  \Q Recall that an inverter switches a 0 to 1 and a 1 to 0. What is the output of the\key\\[-2.5mm] following circuit?

    \begin{answer}[0.75in]
      It continuously switches between on and off.
    \end{answer}

  Feedback occurs when the output of a circuit is ``fed back'' into the input of the circuit. You have heard what happens when the sound from a PA system's speaker gets into a microphone!
