\model{Multi-Bit Adder}

  A circuit like the one built in question 8, that has three inputs and two outputs, a sum and carry, is called a Full Adder.
  It can be represented with either of the images in Figure 6. The difference between them is whether then inputs and outputs are
  on the left or right. While we have had inputs on the left so far, we will soon see how it may be convenient to have the inputs on the right.

  \Q To add a pair of N-digit binary numbers, how many Full Adders do we need? (Hint:\key\\[-2.5mm] how many columns are we adding in question 7?)
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      N Full Adders, one for each column.
    \end{answer}

  \Q Follow the instructions below to make a 3-Bit Adder in Figure 7 to add A + B.

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Given that A is a three-bit number with the least-significant bit on the right (a0) and the most significant bit on the left (a2),
      draw lines connecting each digit of A to the appropriate Full Adder.

      \item Draw lines connecting each digit of B to the appropriate Full Adder.

      \item Draw lines connecting the S output of each Full Adder to the appropriate output (s0-s2).

      \item Draw lines connecting the C output of each Full Adder to the appropriate place.

      \item Draw a component for the input for Cin on the least-significant Full Adder (at the right). (Hint: what is the value needed and what circuit element provides that value?)
    \end{enumerate}
