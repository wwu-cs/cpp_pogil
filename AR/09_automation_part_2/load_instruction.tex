  Figure 1 (copied from the previous lesson) shows a simple programmable computer with the following characteristics:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A counter with 16-bit output that will increment on each clock tick (it can be reset to zero with the Start control line),
    \item Separate addressable memory for code and data that each output an 8-bit value based on the same 16-bit address (the value of the data memory can be set to the current data latch value by the Store control line),
    \item An 8-bit adder that calculates the sum (or difference based on the Subtract control line) of the latch and the value from memory,
    \item A latch that captures the result of the adder on each clock tick (or is cleared based on the Clear sum control line), and
    \item A decoder that takes each 8-bit instruction and sets the control lines appropriately.
  \end{itemize}

  \quest{15 min}

  \Q In Figure 1, the data path into the latch comes from what component?
    \hfill\ans[1in]{Adder}

  \Q In Figure 1, what two instructions are required to get the value of a single memory location into the latch?
    (Hint: what would you add to a value to get the same value?)
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      Clear, Add
    \end{answer}

  Figure 2 adds a new control line and a new component to our computer.

  \Q What are the new elements?
    \hfill\ans{A 2-to-1 Selector and a Selection control line}

  \vspace{10pt}
  A 2-to-1 Selector will pass on one of two inputs based on a control line. In this configuration, if the control line is 0,
  then the value from the adder will be passed to the latch. If the control line is 1, then the value from memory will be passed to the latch.

  \Q How does this circuit simplify loading a value from memory into the latch?
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      Now it takes only one instruction.
    \end{answer}

  \Q Suggest a name and a code for this instruction. (Hint: see the name of Figure 2\key\\[-2.5mm] and the pattern of hexadecimal codes used for previous instructions.)
    \begin{answer}[0.5in]
      Load (0x10)
    \end{answer}
